        dear diary, <br />
        <br />
        i have not been doing so well of late. life has been a tumultuous cycle
        of friendships, the plague, being plagued of work, not feeling like i am
        competent, and drowning- the classic aileen mental and physical barrage.
        <br />
        <br />
        i used to dream that i was drowning, often. swaddled in blankets, i
        would almost suffocate, only to wake up in a trancelike state and gasp
        for air. i was not in the sea that i adored. <br />
        <br />
        only at my lowest lows, like this, can i write of these things. before
        periods like them, i cannot acknowledge my fatigue. i trick myself into
        thinking that sleep, another day, another week, will solve my longings.
        <br />
        <br />
        i have ordered a deck of tarot cards off of aliexpress. they will arrive
        after my birthday. i will ask the already personified cat cards silly
        questions like ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt i love again‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy do i have trust
        issues?‚Äù (except i already know the answer). i will treat shuffling
        cards like therapy, as steven mentioned it was created for. <br />
        <br />
        tarot is an educated guess. it is like a hypothesis, but with less
        evidence, and framed through randomized cats instead of research
        methods. <br />
        <br />
        i constantly romanticize my summer- of weed, of parties, and work. i
        want to flipper through the ocean and ride the kinetic energy of waves.
        i don‚Äôt even mind how sand would find itself in my every crevice, or the
        way i would sunburn from my poorly applied sunscreen. i miss san mateo,
        san francisco, san jose‚Äî every ‚Äòsan‚Äô under the sun.
        <br />
        <br />
        mark my words, sick body. once these pits of former teeth heal- what is
        stopping me from having a fall as fun as my former summer? it will not
        be my schoolwork, of which i have promised to throw aside. it will not
        be friends, of whom i can always make more of. it will not be family,
        whom i hope to visit more. except it probably will be any or all of
        these, because i am thinking wishfully right now.
        <br />
        <br />
        periods of sickness always make me strive to improve my health so that i
        won‚Äôt need to live in pools of bile. they make me want to make the most
        of days (except that i do that sorta already), except through the idea
        of making more ‚Äòfun‚Äô instead of mindful, tiring work. i hope i read this
        when i am unsick. aileen! you need to exercise and eat more. <br />
        <br />

        it is odd and hateful that everything comes out like this, in a public
        substack. i feel betrayed by my once closest and still closest friend,
        betrayed by my sinuses, and betrayed by my own temper. i lay sick and
        sickly in the mind, nauseous but unable to rock away the gaps between my
        teeth.
        <br />
        <br />
        my few consolations- how the dentist said my chinese is good, a
        californian salary, and my tendency to pick the perfect opaqueness of
        grey. soon, one or more of them will not longer be true.
