        i. <br />dear diary, i am working in e7. my macbook burns my thighs and
        i have made a silent commitment to work until she dies and i have no
        choice but to go home. i am so upset. acceptably (circumstance 1) upset,
        justifiably (circumstance 2) upset, but irrationally (emotional
        circumstance x) upset.

        <br />
        <br />
        i ping pong between feeling good, and not good enough. my measure of
        value hums in my brain constant and low like an electric pulse. right
        now i do not feel good enough. i tie my self worth to design, and
        perhaps that is the reason i feel this way. i was dealt a favourable
        hand, which i played mediocrely. i feel silly, loud, and regretful. if
        my expectations were lower, perhaps i would not be here now.
        <br />
        <br />

        ii. <br />i am trying to process this lump of sadness that returns with
        every duo-monthly period i have- this feeling of unfinished business
        that hits me with the energy of high-tide. i cannot concentrate on
        design right now- i feel so unbelievably mediocore. i always return to
        the same open topics until i can tell myself i am better via proof. i do
        not have proof rn, all i have is pity from others.

        <br /><br />i am not scared of working hard. however, i am scared of pig
        & lamb parasites, waking up early, and regret. my regret comes in
        tangles of guilt. i cannot hide my actions. <br /><br />
        iii.<br />
        i wonder whether i really deserve better, or if i brought this upon
        myself.
